# Acoustic_3D_Measurement

# Project Introduction
This project presents a lightweight and efficient method for 3D seabed target measurement using a single forward-looking sonar (FLS), specifically the ARIS EXPLORER 3000 (Acoustic Camera). 
Designed for low-altitude operations, the approach exploits acoustic cast shadow information to infer the height of underwater targets from two sonar frames.
