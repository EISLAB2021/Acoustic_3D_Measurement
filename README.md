# Acoustic_3D_Measurement

# Project Introduction
This project presents a lightweight and efficient method for 3D seabed target measurement using a single forward-looking sonar (FLS), specifically the ARIS EXPLORER 3000 (Acoustic Camera). 
Designed for low-altitude operations, the approach exploits acoustic cast shadow information to infer the height of underwater targets from two sonar frames.

# Scene Illustration
This project leverages acoustic cast shadow information observed from two viewpoints to estimate the height and 3D shape of seafloor objects. By analyzing changes in shadow geometry across frames, we infer spatial structure in a fast and lightweight pipeline suitable for real-time deployment on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) operating in low-visibility and confined environments.
